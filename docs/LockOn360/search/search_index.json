On the package, there is an example character included in Content/LockOn360/Blueprints/Character/LockOnCharacter . This is the character used for the LockOn360 demo, you can use this as your reference. If you're new to Unreal Engine, it's recommended that you start by creating a new project based on the editor's ThirdPerson template. The LockOnCharacter example is more or less compatible with Unreal's ThirdPersonCharacter . Lock-On component setup This step should be performed on the character/actor that you wish to give the lock-on functionality to. Navigate to the character/actor blueprint, open the file. Inside the component tab (usually placed at the top left of the editor) , there should be an \"Add Component\" button. Press the button and add the following components: LockOnManager (required) Contains the logic for handling the 360 lock-on system. KeyPressHandler (optional) Optional component used for handling key press. Used only to ensure that the package can be migrated easily. Not required if you already setup your inputs from inside the Project Settings. Functionality setup Inside the LockOnCharacter, there are several nodes grouped under different colors. Explanation about the colored nodes are given below. Setup Nodes The LockOnManager.Setup node is mandatory and needs to be called before using any of the other functions. The SetupDemoUI node is optional and can be removed/ignored, it's mostly used for demo purposes. Activate/Deactivate/Toggle Lock-On There are 3 functions that can be used to activate/deactivate the Lock-On system. ToggleLockOn ActivateLockOn DeactivateLockOn For demo purpose, the ToggleLockOn function is used as the default action. Switching Targets Switching targets are performed by doing a quick flick towards the direction of the next target. Separate functions are provided depending on whether you flick using a mouse or a gamepad thumbstick. Orbiting Around the Target Use the TryOrbitForward and TryOrbitRight function to move the character around the target during Lock-On. Normal Camera Control and Movement The LockOnManager have 4 important events that you will need to register in your character. OnDefaultCameraYaw OnDefaultCameraPitch OnDefaultMoveForward OnDefaultMoveRight These nodes ensure that normal camera control and movement can be processed when the Lock-On is disabled. Please make sure to connect your camera and movement control nodes to these events.","title":"Setup"},{"location":"setup/#lock-on-360-setup","text":"","title":"Lock-On 360 - Setup"},{"location":"setup/#prepare-a-characteractor","text":"First of all, make sure you have a character/actor ready for the project.
