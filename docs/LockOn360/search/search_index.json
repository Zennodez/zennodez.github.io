Prepare a character/actor First of all, make sure you have a character/actor ready for the project. On the package, there is an example character included in Content/LockOn360/Blueprints/Character/LockOnCharacter . This is the character used for the LockOn360 demo, you can use this as your reference. If you're new to Unreal Engine, it's recommended that you start by creating a new project based on the editor's ThirdPerson template. The LockOnCharacter example is more or less compatible with Unreal's ThirdPersonCharacter . Lock-On component setup Next is to add a LockOnManager component towards the actor/character. You will need to do this to the character/actor that you wish to give the lock-on functionality to. Navigate to the character/actor blueprint, open the file. Inside the component tab (usually placed at the top left of the editor) , there should be an \"Add Component\" button. Press the button and add the following components: LockOnManager (required) Contains the logic for handling the 360 lock-on system. KeyPressHandler (optional) Optional component used for handling key press. Used only to ensure that the package can be migrated easily. Not required if you already setup your inputs from inside the Project Settings. Camera Setup To ensure that the target switching can be performed smoothly, make sure to attach your camera to a SpringArm component. The EnableCameraRotationLag property of the SpringArm will need to be set to true for this to work. If the camera setups above are not performed, the lock-on target switch will be performend without any smooth easing/transition. Functionality setup Inside the LockOnCharacter, there are several nodes grouped under different colors. These will need to be added to your character/actor depending on your requirements. Explanation about the colored nodes are given below. Add Setup Nodes The LockOnManager.Setup node is mandatory and needs to be called before using any of the other functions. The SetupDemoUI node is optional and can be removed/ignored, it's mostly used for demo purposes. How to Activate/Deactivate Lock-On There are 3 functions that can be used to activate/deactivate the Lock-On system. ToggleLockOn ActivateLockOn DeactivateLockOn Each nodes performs the action that their names implied. For demo purpose, the ToggleLockOn function is used as the default action on the example LockOnCharacter . You should add it to How to Switch Target Switching targets are performed by doing a quick flick towards the direction of the next target. Separate functions are provided depending on whether you flick using a mouse or a gamepad thumbstick. Orbiting Around the Target Use the TryOrbitForward and TryOrbitRight function to move the character around the target during Lock-On. This should be used to replace normal movement when the lock-on is active. Normal Camera Control and Movement The lock-on system expects that you connect the direct values from your movement and camera inputs to the LockOnManager 's orbit and flick functions. Due to this, to perform normal camera and movement control (when the lock-on is off) , you will need to add the following events in your character/actor. For camera control: OnGamepadCameraYaw OnGamepadCameraPitch OnMouseCameraYaw OnMouseCameraPitch For normal movement: OnDefaultMoveForward OnDefaultMoveRight These nodes ensure that normal camera control and movement can be processed when the Lock-On is disabled. Do make sure to connect your camera and movement control nodes to these events.","title":"Lock-On Setup"},{"location":"setup/#lock-on-setup","text":"These steps are performed on the character/actor that you wish to add the lock-on functionality to, not the target.","title":"Lock-On Setup"},{"location":"setup/#prepare-a-characteractor","text":"First of all, make sure you have a character/actor ready for the project.

Overview The LockOnTarget component is used to designate the location of the target. The LockOnManager component will detect any LockOnTarget that is visible from the camera, within the designated search radius. You can add more than one of these LockOnTarget components inside your actor/character. These can be used to register multiple target points inside an actor, for example to represent separate target points on a character's limbs or head, or maybe a vehicle's doors or wheels. For reference, the package includes some target examples in Content/LockOn360/Blueprints/Actors . These includes, TargetBall Used to demonstrate single target lock-on. TargetCharacter Used to demonstrate multiple target lock-on. Steps For detailed steps on how to add LockOnTarget to your actor, Navigate to the character/actor blueprint that you wish to use as your target, open the file. Press the Add Component button (top left section of the editor, inside the component tab) . Add one or more LockOnTarget components as required. You can adjust the placement of the LockOnTarget from the Viewport editor of you actor's/character's blueprint. The component can be attached to a bone/socket if required, it can be accessed from the details tab.","title":"Target Setup"},{"location":"targetsetup/#lock-on-target-setup","text":"These steps are performed on the character/actor that you wish to use as a target.","title":"Lock-On Target Setup"},{"location":"targetsetup/#overview","text":"The LockOnTarget component is used to designate the location of the target.
