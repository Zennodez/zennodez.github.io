In case you're not sure where to find these settings, Open your character blueprint, select the SlowMoComponent on your character's component tab, then check the Details tab. (Details tab is usually on the right side of your screen). Slow Mo Time Settings Slow Mo Time Modifier How fast should time passed during Slow Mo. 0 = time stops 1 = normal time flow >1 = time speedup Actor Time Reference The time reference on which the value of ActorTimeMultiplier is to be based upon. Depending on this value, ActorTimeMultiplier will be calculated as either relative to the Slow Mo timeflow, or relative to the normal timeflow. Actor Time Multiplier A multiplier of how fast the actor's timeflow is, relative to the values of ActorTimeReference and SlowMoTimeModifier. 1 = actor moves according to the relative timeflow >1 = actor moves faster than the relative timeflow 0-1 = actor moves slower than the relative timeflow Slow Mo Camera Control Slow Mo Yaw Modifier The camera's yaw value modifier during Slow Mo. This determines how far the camera moves during Slow Mo, relative to its normal values. To control how fast the camera moves during Slow Mo, see CameraInterpSpeed . 1 = same as normal time. Slow Mo Pitch Modifier The camera's pitch value modifier during Slow Mo. This determines how far the camera moves during Slow Mo, relative to its normal values. To control how fast the camera moves during Slow Mo, see CameraInterpSpeed . 1 = same as normal time. CameraInterpSpeed Interpolation speed, how quickly should the camera reaches its target during Slow Mo. This is used as a delay lag so that the camera feels a bit slower when the Slow Mo is activated. <0 = no delay lag. 0 = camera not moving. >0 = higher value is faster. InputYawScale This is used to modify how far PlayerController's AddYawInput will move your camera when given an input value. If using UE4, you should set this to the same value as your PlayerController's InputYawScale. If using UE5, you should set this to 1 or see the documentation on (deprecated) InputYawScale . InputPitchScale This is used to modify how far PlayerController's AddPitchInput will move your camera when given an input value. If using UE4, you should set this to the same value as your PlayerController's InputPitchScale. If using UE5, you should set this to 1 or see the documentation on (deprecated) InputPitchScale . Slow Mo Visual Effect Camera Modifier The Camera Modifier effect used during Slow Mo, by default set to CamMod_SlowMotion . The default modifier generates the same effect as shown in the demo. You can replace this with your own camera modifier if you wish. FOV_Oscillation How strong should the camera oscillates during Slow Mo. Mostly used to accompany the default heartbeat sound effect. Can be set to 0 if not required. 0 = no oscillation >0 = stronger oscillation FOV_OscillationFrequency The frequency at which your camera should shake during Slow Mo. Can be set to 0 if not required. 0 = no oscillation >0 = faster oscillation Slow Mo Camera Modifier (Settings Override) These settings that can be used to override some of the CameraModifier values from inside the character blueprint. The override only works for CameraModifier child classes that implements the I_CamMod interface. If you need this feature, make sure to implement both SetupValues and GetValues of I_CamMod inside your CameraModifier child class. Please refer to the CamMod_SlowMotion blueprint for further reference. IsOverrideCameraModifierSettings Set to true to override some of the camera modifier settings. If you prefer to handle all of your screen effects from the CameraModifier, make sure to turn this to false . Only applied if the Camera Modifier implements I_CamMod . CameraFOV_Modifier The camera's field of view modifier during Slow Mo, compared to its original FOV. Only works if the Camera Modifier implements I_CamMod . 1 = camera's default FOV. 0-1 = lower FOV. >1 = higher FOV. CameraDistanceModifier Modifier of the camera's distance offset to the character during Slow Mo. Only works if the Camera Modifier implements I_CamMod . 1 = 1 = normal offset. 0-1 = nearer to the character. >1 = further from the character. CameraTint The color tint of the camera during Slow Mo. Setting this to black will disable the tint. CameraTintStrength The intensity of the CameraTint. Setting this to 0 will disable the tint. Slow Mo Sound Effects The following properties are expected to be filled with Sound Cue s. If you'd like to use your own custom sound effect, make sure to check the details on how the default Sound Cue s are implemented in this package. If you're not familiar with how the Sound Cue works, it's recommended that you at least do the following steps, Copy the default Sound Cues provided in this package. Open them in your editor, and replace the Wave Player node's Sound Wave value with your custom SFX asset. SFX_BeginSlowMo The sound effect played when Slow Mo is turned on. SFX_DuringSlowMo The sound effect played during the duration of the Slow Mo. By default it is set to the sound of a heartbeat. Make sure that the SFX you used is looped. SFX_EndSlowMo The sound effect played when Slow Mo is turned off. Slow Mo Sound Settings SoundStartInterpSpeed Interpolation speed, how quickly should the looped sound starts. Higher value is faster. SoundEndInterpSpeed Interpolation speed, how quickly should the looped sound ends. Higher value is faster.

Open your character blueprint, click on the Add Component button, and add the SlowMoComponent to your character. The component itself can be found in Content/TheSlowMoKit/Components/SlowMoComponent . Add the activation triggers Next, you will need to add the functions required to activate/deactivate the slow motion effect. There are 4 nodes that you can use for this. StartSlowMotion , as the name implied, used to start the slow motion effect. StopSlowMotion , as the name implied, used to stop the slow motion effect. ToggleSlowMotion , this will toggle the slow motion effect on/off, depending on the current state. TimedSlowMotion , this will trigger a timed slow motion effect that will last until the given duration (in seconds) is passed. There's at least 3 common ways on how to use these functions. If you wish to start/stop the slow motion using a single button press, connect the ToggleSlowMotion to your button input. If you wish to activate the slow motion when a button/trigger is being held down, connect the button press input to StartSlowMotion , and the button release input to StopSlowMotion . If you wish to activate the slow motion effect, but only for a limited time/duration, you can substitute the StartSlowMotion node in Activation02 and replace it with the TimedSlowMotion node instead. Set the duration (in seconds) of the Slow Mo effect in the duration parameter. Adjust the Slow Mo camera input nodes Next is how to adjust the rotation control during Slow Mo. In essence, you will need to substitute your normal camera control inputs with the one provided by the SlowMoComponent. Steps as follows. Select the SlowMoComponent from your component tabs, drag it into your Event Graph, Pull AddControlYaw and AddControlPitch from the node. Find your default input nodes for yaw and pitch, and connect them to the SlowMoComponent 's AddControlYaw and AddControlPitch . Don't delete your previous camera control logic, we'll use them for the next steps. Next, select the SlowMoComponent again from your component tabs. Go to the Details tab, scroll down until you find the Events section. You should find the following buttons: InputAxis_DefaultYaw InputAxis_DefaultPitch Press both of these buttons, it will add 2 event nodes on your Event Graph. Find your default camera control logic (the one you disconnect from the inputs previously), Connect your default camera control logic to both InputAxis_DefaultYaw and InputAxis_DefaultPitch . And you're done! The steps above should cover all the basics on how to apply The Slow Mo Kit to your character. Make sure to test it first and see if it works on your side.
