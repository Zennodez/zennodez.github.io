The inputs used in this Event Graph is the same one as the default control scheme used for the Female Shooter demo. If you want to test whether the template works on your character or not, you can try copying all of the nodes from the Event Graph and then paste it to your character. This will give your character all of the functionalities that is available in the demo. A step by step guide can be found here in case you encounter some problem during the process. Once you're done with adding all the functionalities that you might need, we will next proceed to preparing the animation system for your character . If you need more info about the available actions, details can be found in the sections below. Demo Related Nodes The nodes with red backgrounds are used to provide functionalities for the demo. These includes, Toggle Demo UI Used to turn on/off the UI interface of the Female Shooter demo. Quit Game Quit the game by pressing Esc or Special Left button. These nodes are mostly for interacting with the user interface of the demo build, can be excluded if you're not going to use the Demo UI. They are not mandatory for the Female Shooter template to function properly. Camera Switcher Nodes On the area below the setup, you can see nodes used for the Camera Switcher. Camera Switcher component used to be optional in 1.2.0, mostly used for camera switching mechanism. But as of 1.3.0, they are required to ensure that the aiming function can works properly. For details on how to setup Camera Switcher's aiming functionality, see Aim Mode Guide . For details on how to use the rest of Camera Switcher functions, see the following article . Setup Nodes The content of the setup nodes can also be omitted depending on your requirements. If you do not wish to use them, you can either exclude them when you copy the template nodes, or deactivate them by unchecking their setup functions in the 'Begin Play and Tick' section. Locomotion Nodes These are the nodes used for the Female Shooter locomotion, mainly handled by the GunnerGirlComponent. The list of inputs/actions available within these nodes includes, Character Movement Move the character. Positive AxisValue move the character forward or right, negative value backwards or left. Used for both gamepad and keyboard inputs in the default setup. On the gamepad, default input is set to Left Thumbstick . Light press will make the character walk, strong press make the character run. On the keyboard, default input is set to ASDW and handled by the KeyPresshandler component. The KeyPressHandler component is used here because the Female Shooter asset does not come with input registers on the project settings. Usage of this component is optional and is not required if you already register your inputs in the project settings. Walk/UnWalk Activate/deactivate walking mode. Used for keyboard inputs only in the default setup. Default input is set to Left Shift . Walking is activated when the key is held down, deactivated when the key is released. The gamepad input for walking does not use this function. Walking for gamepad is done by modifying the AxisValue parameter of MoveForward and MoveSideward instead. Crouch Activate/deactivate crouching. Used for both gamepad and keyboard inputs in the default setup. Default inputs are set to Left Ctrl , Left Alt , and Right Shoulder . Crouch is activated when the key is held down, deactivated when the key is released. Crouch walk can be performed by moving the character while crouching. Roll Perform rolling when the character is on the ground. Used for both gamepad and keyboard inputs in the default setup. The duration of the roll is controlled by the rolling animation. Default inputs are set to E and Facebutton Right . Jump Action Trigger either a normal jump, double jump, or a somersault. Used for both gamepad and keyboard inputs in the default setup. Default inputs are set to Spacebar and Facebutton Bottom . There are 3 jump actions that can be performed depending on the context, If the character is on the ground, a normal jump will be performed. If the character is airborne and the parameter IsAllowSomersault is set to true , the character will perform a somersault. By default, the somersault direction can be controlled using the Left Thumbstick . If no somersault direction is given, the character will perform a somersault to the direction of their current movement. If the character is airborne and the parameter IsAllowSomersault is set to false , the character will perform a double jump. Do make sure that the value of JumpMaxCount is set to higher than 1 to enable the double jump functionality. If you're not sure how to do this, see this article for instructions. Camera Control Perform basic camera control. Used for both gamepad and keyboard inputs in the default setup. Default input is controlled using the Right Thumbstick or Mouse Movement . Camera speed can be modified using either the TurnRatePerSecond or Multiplier variables. Camera direction can be inverted using the IsInverted variable. Strafe Mode Switch between normal movement and strafing movement (character will always face forward during strafe mode) . Used for both gamepad and keyboard inputs in the default setup. Default inputs are set to Y and Facebutton Top . Flashlight Used to the equip/unequip the flashlight and to turn the lights on/off (once equipped). Used for both gamepad and keyboard inputs in the default setup. Default inputs are set to Q and D-Pad Down . Further details on each flashlight functions can be found in this guide . Shooting Nodes These are the nodes used to enable the shooting system of the character, mainly handled by the TwinGunhandler. The list of inputs/actions available within these nodes includes, Gun Equip/Unequip (Normal + Gunspin) Equip/Unequip the guns to the character's hands. Used for both gamepad and keyboard inputs in the default setup. Default input to toggle the non-gunspin animation is set to 1 and Left Shoulder Button . Default input to toggle the gunspinning version is set to 2 and D-Pad Up . Gun Shoot Start/stop shooting using both guns. The shots will be fired according to the pattern of the currently active ShootingPattern variable. A muzzle flash will be spawned on each gun's muzzle whenever the shot is triggered. Used for both gamepad and keyboard inputs in the default setup. Default input is set to Right Trigger and Left Mouse Button . Hold the key to start shooting, release the key to stop shooting. This function triggers the start of the shooting animation. The timing of when the actual shot is fired is determined by the position of the LeftGunShot notify inside the animation. See the Notify sections for more information. Individual Shooting Activate individual gunhand shooting mode. When either one of these functions are called and activated, the character will shoot from 1 hand only, either left or right. Used for both gamepad and keyboard inputs in the default setup. Default input is set to D-Pad Left and Z for left hand shooting. Default input is set to D-Pad Right and C for right hand shooting.

There are several new features that was added to 1.3.0, most of them were added to implement the dual shooting/projectile mechanism to the template as well as to facilitate a more modular approach to the system as a whole. Required Components In Female Shooter 1.3.0, the functionalities are mostly separated into 2 components. GunnerGirlComponent , which handles most of the locomotion TwinGunHandler , which handles parts related to the shooting mechanism CameraSwitcher also take a slightly larger role to handle the camera aspect of the character, specifically the aim function (previously not implemented in 1.2.0) The components can be found in the Content/FemaleShooter/Blueprint/Component folder. To showcase how to use these components, please check inside the Content/FemaleShooter/Blueprint/Character folder. You will find 2 Character Blueprints there, The GunnerGirl_Character , which serves as an example of how to use the full functionalities of the package, And the ThirdPersonModCharacter , which serves as an example on how to add only the dual gun shooting mechanism to your existing character. For this guide, we will focus on the GunnerGirl_Character blueprint. Open the blueprint file and head to the event graph, the changes from 1.2.0 to 1.3.0 will be listed in the sections below. Gun Equip/Unequip Functions The Gun Equip/Unequip functions was previously part of the GunnerGirlComponent . They are now assigned to TwinGunHandler . Shooting Functions Shooting now produces both a muzzle flash and a projectile that can affect the target that it hits. The hand and arm animations of the character have also been adjusted to follow the direction of where the shot is directed. In 1.3.0, the implementation of the functions was relocated from GunnerGirlComponent to TwinGunhandler . The function names have also been updated, Shoot -> StartShooting UnShoot -> StopShooting Aim Mode Aim Mode is currently available from the CameraSwitcher component. To use this, you will first need to call RegisterAimCamera to define which camera would be allowed to perform the Aim action. You can then use the following functions to activate/deactivate the AimMode For this version, Dynamic Aim supports trigger sensitivy. However, this is experimental at the moment, and might actually change in the future. Muzzle Flash Effect Previously, in 1.2.0, Muzzle Flash effect is part of the GunnerGirlComponent . You can change it by selecting GunnerGirlComponent, go to the Details tab, Effects, and change the value of MuzzleFlashParticle . In 1.3.0, the MuzzleFlashParticle variable are now part of the AmmoData value. This is a custom dataset object that controls settings related to the projectile. The AmmoData setting can be found by selecting TwinGunhandler, go to Details tab, Shooting, and find the value of AmmoData . You can change the values from either the details tab of the TwinGunHandler, or by using the AssignAmmo function during runtime. By default, the FemaleShooter package includes 3 default AmmoData setting that can be used as examples. You can find it in Content/FemaleShooter/Blueprint/Data/Ammo . If you open one of the AmmoData files there, you will find that the MuzzleFlashEffect property is registered inside. There are several other properties that you can modify inside the dataset, including, Bullet Mesh , the static mesh used for your bullet Muzzle Flash Effect , the muzzle flash effect that is generated when you shot a projectile Trail Effect , the bullet trail effect for your projectile Impact Effect , the effect played when your bullet hit something Bullet Speed , the velocity of your bullet Gravity , the effect of gravity on your bullet (0 means no effect from gravity, 1 is 1G normal gravity) Impact Modifier , how strong will the impact be when your bullet hit an object (this is affected by the bullet velocity) Lifetime , how long should your bullet stay alive before it got removed from the world You can create your own custom AmmoData by creating a duplicate of one of the default AmmoData files above, and modifying the values. However, if you wish to do it manually, the steps are available here Changing Equipments In 1.2.0, there are 4 equipments that can be assigned to the character. Left Gun Class Right Gun Class Left Holster Class Right Holster Class In 1.3.0, this approach is not used anymore. User can instead set any amount of equipment they need on the character by changing the EquipmentSet value of the TwinGunHandler . You will still need to inform the system of the Identifier that you will be using for LeftGunIdentifier and RightGunIdentifier , so the system can figure out which equipment to be used as the guns. You can change the EquipmentSet during runtime by calling LoadEquipmentSet from the TwinGunHandler. By default, the FemaleShooter package provides 2 default EquipmentSet that can be used as examples. This can be found in Content/FemaleShooter/Blueprint/Data/Equipment . Just like AmmoData, these are made using custom Data Asset. If you want to create your custom EquipmentSet manually, the steps is the same as the one used to create an AmmoData. If you open one of the example AmmoData, you will see a list of equipments. Each equipment contains the following properties, Identifier , this should be unique for each equipment. ActorClass , the blueprint actor class of your equipment, this is similar to the Left Gun Class/Right Gun Class used in 1.2.0 StorageSocketName , this is the socket where your equipment will be attached to by default EquipSocketName , this is the socket where your equipment will be attached to when it's equipped This is mostly used for the guns, which can either be stored in the holster socket, or equipped in the hand socket. You can add as much equipment as you need, as long as each have a different identifier. The identifier you registered in this EquipmentSet will be the one used by the TwinGunHandler to locate your LeftGunIdentifier and RightGunIdentifier . Custom Animations Previously, the animation variables used to implement custom animations are placed exclusively inside GunnerGirlComponent . In 1.3.0, half of the animations was relocated. The gun-related animations are now assigned to TwinGunHandler , while the locomotion parts still assigned to GunnerGirlComponent . The list of animations that can be replaced by the user are as follows. GunnerGirlComponent animations Walking/Running ( Blend Walk Run ) Roll ( Blend Roll ) Crouch ( Blend Crouch ) Jump Start ( Blend Jump Start ) Jump Loop ( Blend Jump Loop ) Jump Landing ( Anim Jump Landing ) Somersault ( Blend Somersault ) TwinGunHandler animations Gun Idle ( Anim Gun Idle ) Equip Normal ( Anim Equip Normal ) Equip Gunspin ( Anim Equip Spin ) Unequip Normal ( Anim Unequip Normal ) Unequip Spin ( Anim Unequip Spin ) Gun Aim Pose for the arm/hands ( Blend Gun Aim ) Left Hand Gun Shoot Pose ( Blend Shoot Left ) Right Hand Gun Shoot Pose ( Blend Shoot Right ) The property IsFallbackToDefaultAnimation is also provided. This will control whether the system should fallback and play the default animations included with the package, if there is no custom animations registered from the GunnerGirlComponent . To make it a bit clearer, If the property is set to false , user will need to provide all of the custom animations required to ensure that the system works as intended. If the property is set to true , user can provide only the animations that they wish to change, the rest of the empty ones will be handled by the default animations. Shooting Pattern Starting from 1.3.0, you can adjust the Shooting Pattern of your character. The setting is implemented using Data Asset, just like AmmoData and EquipmentSet. The value can be found in the Details tab of TwinGunHandler , find Shooting, and navigate to ShootingPattern. You can change the value of the ShootingPattern during runtime by calling AssignShootingPattern from TwinGunHandler. The FemaleShooter package provides 6 default ShootingPattern as examples. These patterns can be found in Content/FemaleShooter/Blueprint/Data/ShootingPattern . Two of them, Shooting_LeftOnly and Shooting_RightOnly , are specifically set to facilitate the individual shooting system. If you open one of the files, you will see a list of entries. The properties are explained below, Label , the label used for your ShootingPattern setting This isn't used for much at the moment, mostly to inform the User Interface of the active ShootingPattern that you're currently using. ShootingHand , which is the hand where your projectile will be shot from The valid values are LeftHand and RightHand . BothHands is not considered as a valid value for the current version. NextDelay , which is the cooldown time until the next projectile is allowed to be shot from the guns For precaution, make sure not to set the value to a very low number. A very low value might end up with the projectile not getting spawned. You can create your own custom ShootingPattern by creating another Data Asset, just like you did with AmmoData and EquipmentSet. The steps are the same. Multiplayer Replication (Not Supported) No multiplayer replication features will be supported as of version 1.3.0. This is unfortunate, but the (experimental) multiplayer features that was introduced in 1.2.0 will not be carried to 1.3.0. This is mostly due to difficulties in maintaining and testing the replications with several new features introduced into the package.

There are several new features that was added to 1.3.0, most of them were added to implement the dual shooting/projectile mechanism to the template as well as to facilitate a more modular approach to the system as a whole. If you're new to the package, you can try skipping the migration guide for now and move to template overview and guide on the next page . Required Components In Female Shooter 1.3.0, the functionalities are mostly separated into 2 components. GunnerGirlComponent , which handles most of the locomotion TwinGunHandler , which handles parts related to the shooting mechanism CameraSwitcher also take a slightly larger role to handle the camera aspect of the character, specifically the aim function (previously not implemented in 1.2.0) The components can be found in the Content/FemaleShooter/Blueprint/Component folder. To showcase how to use these components, please check inside the Content/FemaleShooter/Blueprint/Character folder. You will find 2 Character Blueprints there, The GunnerGirl_Character , which serves as an example of how to use the full functionalities of the package, And the ThirdPersonModCharacter , which serves as an example on how to add only the dual gun shooting mechanism to your existing character. You can check either one of these character blueprints to learn how to implement the FemaleShooter functionalities into a character. For this guide, we will focus on the changes that have been implemented into the GunnerGirl_Character blueprint. Open the blueprint file and head to the event graph, the changes from 1.2.0 to 1.3.0 will be listed in the sections below. Gun Equip/Unequip Functions In 1.2.0, the Gun Equip/Unequip functions was previously part of the GunnerGirlComponent . There was some limitations before where the character will stop moving when equip/unequip functions are called. In 1.3.0, they are now assigned to TwinGunHandler . No limitations are present in the current version, character can equip/unequip their weapons while on the move. Shooting Functions Shooting now produces both a muzzle flash and a projectile that can affect the target that it hits. The hand and arm animations of the character have also been adjusted to follow the direction of where the shot is directed. In 1.3.0, the implementation of the functions was relocated from GunnerGirlComponent to TwinGunhandler . The function names have also been updated, Shoot -> StartShooting UnShoot -> StopShooting Aim Mode Aim Mode is currently available from the CameraSwitcher component. To use this, you will first need to call RegisterAimCamera to define which camera would be allowed to perform the Aim action. You can then use the following functions to activate/deactivate the AimMode You will also need to call some setup functions before the game starts to ensure that TwinGunHandler and CameraSwitcher can communicate with each other. An example setup can be found in the Event Graph of the GunnerGirl_Character. Flashlight Flashlight is available since 1.3.0. It is used by adding the FlashlightComponent to an actor. GunnerGirl_Character, RevolverGun, and Handgun each have a FlashlightComponent attached to them. GunnerGirlComponent also comes with a set of functions that can be used to control the flashlights that is attached to the character and the guns. Guide on how to use these functions can be found here . Muzzle Flash Effect Previously, in 1.2.0, Muzzle Flash effect was part of the GunnerGirlComponent . It was customizable by going to the Details tab of GunnerGirlComponent and modifying the value of MuzzleFlashParticle . In 1.3.0, MuzzleFlashParticle is now part of the AmmoData value, a custom dataset object that controls various settings related to the projectile. AmmoData can be customized by going to the Details tab of TwinGunhandler and changing the value of AmmoData . For details on how to adjust the muzzle flash effect from AmmoData, see Ammo Data Setup . Changing Equipments In 1.2.0, there are 4 equipments that can be assigned to the character. Left Gun Class Right Gun Class Left Holster Class Right Holster Class In 1.3.0, this approach is not used anymore. User can instead set any amount of equipment they need on the character by changing the EquipmentSet value of the TwinGunHandler . For details on how to do this, see Equipment Set Guide . Custom Animations Starting from version 1.2.0, you can substitute the default animations included in Female Shooter template with your own custom animations. In 1.2.0, the animation variables used to implement custom animations are placed exclusively inside GunnerGirlComponent . In 1.3.0, half of the animations was relocated. The gun-related animations are now assigned to TwinGunHandler , while the locomotion parts still assigned to GunnerGirlComponent . For more details on the new custom animation system, see the Custom Animations Guide . Notify Events There's also changes to the notification system used to communicate between the animations and the components. In 1.2.0, AnimNotify is used to trigger actions from the animation, with additional code written inside the Animation Blueprint. In 1.3.0, gun related animations uses TwinGunNotify , while locomotion related animations uses GunnerGirlNotify . This is done to facilitate the sub-graph approach, minimize the amount of code that needs to be written on the Animation Blueprint, and to let the notification be sent directly to the components. For the list of notify events used by the FemaleShooter template, see this article . Animation Blueprints In 1.3.0, two new Animation Blueprints was added. GunnerMovement_AnimBP , containing the animation control for the gunner girl's locomotion system TwinGun_AnimBP , containing the animation control for the shooting system These animation blueprints can be used independently from each other. Both of them are meant to be used using a sub-graph approach. There are 2 examples given on how to use these new animation blueprints. The example where TwinGun_AnimBP is used and blended with the default ThirdPerson_Character animation blueprint can be found in, Content/FemaleShooter/Asset/GunnerGirl/Anim/UE4_Mannequin_Animation/ThirdPersonMod_AnimBP . While example for the animation blueprint that was used for the Female Shooter demo can be found in, Content/FemaleShooter/Asset/GunnerGirl/Anim/GunnerGirl_AnimBP . For more details on how to use the animation blueprints, see the Setup Animation Guide . Shooting Pattern Starting from 1.3.0, you can adjust the Shooting Pattern of your character. This will affect the timing as well as the gunhand that you use to shoot a projectile. Details can be seen in Shooting Pattern Guide . Multiplayer Replication (Not Supported) Multiplayer replication is not supported as of version 1.3.0. This is mostly due to difficulties in maintaining and testing the replications with several new features introduced into the package.

This is the default animation blueprint used for the GunnerGirl_Character Explanations for both examples can be seen in this article . Using the example animation blueprints on an existing character Assuming you haven't made any existing animation blueprints of your own, or you just want to use the provided example animations blueprints on your character. There are 2 ways to do this, You can reassign the skeleton for your skeletal mesh , (might not work on every mesh) Or you can retarget the Animation Blueprint to your skeletal mesh (recommended) Details can be found below. Reassigning the Skeleton Reassigning skeleton is the faster way of the two, but it will not work on every skeletal mesh. The GunnerGirl_Skeleton is based on the rescaled version of UE4 Mannequin skeleton, so any skeletal mesh whose skeleton is based on the UE4 mannequin will most likely work with minimal issue when using this method. However, it's not really recommended to use this approach since it might not work with skeletal mesh whose joint orientation is set differently from the UE4 Mannequin. With that said, the steps are as follows, Right click on the skeletal mesh you wish to use for your character, Choose Skeleton, then choose Assign Skeleton A dialog window will appear, telling you to choose a skeleton. Choose the GunnerGirl_Skeleton, then press Accept. This will disassociate your mesh from its original skeleton, and set the GunnerGirl_Skeleton as your new skeleton. If reassignment is the method you choose, the animation blueprint that you'll be using for the next step is located at Content/FemaleShooter/Asset/GunnerGirl/Anim/GunnerGirl_AnimBP . Once you're ready, you can continue with the process and see the next steps here . Retarget the Animation Blueprint Retargeting the animation blueprint to your existing skeleton might take a little bit more time to perform. However, this approach can be done on most skeletal mesh, even if the skeleton skeleton structure is not based on the UE4 Mannequin. Instructions on how to retarget the Female Shooter animation blueprint to your character are as written below, First, you will need prepare your skeleton for the retargeting process. Detailed instruction on how to do this can be found in the retargeting preparation guide . Next, navigate to Content/FemaleShooter/Asset/GunnerGirl/Anim/GunnerGirl_AnimBP Right click on the file, choose Retarget Anim Blueprints, then choose Duplicate Anim Blueprints and Retarget A dialog window will appear. You will need to choose the skeleton asset of your chosen skeletal mesh here. Try unchecking the Show Only Compatible Skeletons option if your skeleton asset is not listed on the option. [Optional] Add a prefix and assign the folder for the New Asset Name This step is optional, but recommended. It might be helpful when you need to locate the newly generated asset using its name. Press the Retarget button Once the retargeting is done, several new files will be generated into your project. If retargeting is the approach you choose, the animation blueprint that you'll be using for the next step will be the one that the system generated for you based on the GunnerGirl_AnimBP animation blueprint. Once you're done with the retargeting process, you can proceed to the next steps by going here .

The inputs used in this Event Graph is the same one as the default control scheme used for the Female Shooter demo. To speed things up, you can just copy all of the nodes from the Event Graph and then paste it to your character. That will give your character all of the functionalities that is available in the demo. Once you've pasted the nodes on your character, try compiling the blueprint. There's a possibility that you might get the following error. If that happens, Reselect all of the nodes that you've just pasted on the character, Right Click on one of them, choose Refresh Nodes. Try recompiling the character blueprint again and see if the problem persists. In the case that the error still appear after all that, try sending a message to one of our channels. We'll try and take a look at what the problem might be. When using an existing character, make sure to do some extra check to ensure that the input events used by the character do not overlap with the ones provided by the template. If there's no more problem after pasting the nodes, we will next proceed to preparing the animation system for your character . Also, if you wish to have a more detailed explanation on what each nodes do, the descriptions are included in the sections below. Demo Nodes The nodes on the top-right area are used to provide functionalities for the demo. These includes, Toggle Demo UI Used to turn on/off the UI interface of the Female Shooter demo. Quit Game Quit the game by pressing Esc or Special Left button. These nodes are not required for the Female Shooter template to function properly. They can be excluded if necessary. Camera Switcher Nodes On the area below the setup, you can see nodes used for the Camera Switcher. The Camera Switcher nodes are also not required, but might be useful if you need a smooth camera switching mechanism for your project. Details on how to use the Camera Switcher component can be found in the following article . Setup Nodes The content of the setup nodes can also be omitted depending on your requirements. If you do not wish to use them, you can either exclude them when you copy the template nodes, Or you simply deactivate them by unchecking their setup functions in the 'Begin Play and Tick' section. See the picture below for details. Female Shooter Nodes The nodes on the bottom area are the ones that are mainly required for the template. The list of inputs/actions available within these nodes includes, Character Movement (Gamepad) Used to move the character using the Left Thumbstick . Light press will make the character walk, strong press make the character run. Character Movement (Keyboard) Used to move the character using the keyboard. Default input is set to ASDW and handled by the KeyPresshandler component. The KeyPressHandler component is used here because the Female Shooter asset does not come with input registers on the project settings. Usage of this component is optional and is not required if you already register your inputs in the project settings. Walk Modifier (Keyboard) Used to activate walking mode from the keyboard. Walk is activated when the key is held down, deactivated when the key is released. Default input is set to Left Shift . Crouch Used to activate crouching. Crouch is activated when the key is held down, deactivated when the key is released. Crouch walk can be performed by moving the character while crouching. Default inputs are set to Left Ctrl , Left Alt , and Right Shoulder . Roll Used to perform rolling, can only be done when you're footed on the ground. Default inputs are set to E and Facebutton Right . Jump, Double Jump, and Somersault Used to trigger a jump action. Default inputs are set to Spacebar and Facebutton Bottom . There are 3 jump actions that can be performed depending on the context, If the character is on the ground, a normal jump will be performed. If the character is airborne and the parameter IsAllowSomersault is checked, this will tell the character to perform a somersault. By default, the somersault direction can be controlled using the Left Thumbstick . If no somersault direction is given, the character will perform a somersault to the direction of their current movement. If the character is airborne + parameter IsAllowSomersault is unchecked, the character will perform a double jump. Do make sure that the value of JumpMaxCount is set to higher than 1 to enable the double jump functionality. If you're not sure how to do this, see this article for instructions. Gun Equip/Unequip (Normal + Gunspin) (Keyboard) Used to toggle between equipping/unequipping the guns to the character's hands. Default input for the non-gunspin animation is set to 1 . Default input for the gunspinning version is set to 2 . Gun Equip/Unequip (Gunspin) (Gamepad) Used to perform a gunspinning equip/unequip and move the guns to the character's hands. Default input to equip guns is set to D-Pad Up . Default input to unequip guns is set to D-Pad Down . Gun Equip/Unequip (Normal) (Gamepad) Used to normally equip/unequip the guns to the character's hands. Default input is set to Left Trigger . Hold button to equip guns, release button to unequip guns. Gun Shoot Used to activate the shooting animation of the character. The shots will be fired alternatingly between the left gun and the right gun. A muzzle flash will be spawned on each gun's muzzle whenever the shot is triggered. Hold the key to start shooting, release the key to stop shooting. Default input is set to Right Trigger and Left Mouse Button . This function only activate the shooting animation, not the actual shot itself. The timing of when the actual shot is fired is determined by the animation. See the Anim Notify sections for Anim_GunShoot_LeftArm and Anim_GunShoot_RightArm for details on how to modify the timing of the actual shot. Camera Control Used to perform basic camera control. Default input is controlled using the Right Thumbstick . Camera speed can be modified using either the TurnRatePerSecond or Multiplier variables. Camera direction can be inverted using the IsInverted variable. Toggle Strafe Mode Used to toggle between normal movement and strafing movement. Default inputs are set to Y and Facebutton Top .

If no somersault direction is given, the character will perform a somersault to the direction of their current movement. If the character is airborne + parameter IsAllowSomersault is unchecked, the character will perform a double jump. Do make sure that the value of JumpMaxCount is set to higher than 1 to enable the double jump functionality. If you're not sure how to do this, see this article for instructions. Gun Equip/Unequip (Normal + Gunspin) (Keyboard) Used to toggle between equipping/unequipping the guns to the character's hands. Default input for the non-gunspin animation is set to 1 . Default input for the gunspinning version is set to 2 . Gun Equip/Unequip (Gunspin) (Gamepad) Used to perform a gunspinning equip/unequip and move the guns to the character's hands. Default input to equip guns is set to D-Pad Up . Default input to unequip guns is set to D-Pad Down . Gun Equip/Unequip (Normal) (Gamepad) Used to normally equip/unequip the guns to the character's hands. Default input is set to Left Trigger . Hold button to equip guns, release button to unequip guns. Gun Shoot Used to activate the shooting animation of the character. The shots will be fired alternatingly between the left gun and the right gun. A muzzle flash will be spawned on each gun's muzzle whenever the shot is triggered. Hold the key to start shooting, release the key to stop shooting. Default input is set to Right Trigger and Left Mouse Button . This function only activate the shooting animation, not the actual shot itself. The timing of when the actual shot is fired is determined by the animation. See the Anim Notify sections for Anim_GunShoot_LeftArm and Anim_GunShoot_RightArm for details on how to modify the timing of the actual shot. Camera Control Used to perform basic camera control. Default input is controlled using the Right Thumbstick . Camera speed can be modified using either the TurnRatePerSecond or Multiplier variables. Camera direction can be inverted using the IsInverted variable. Toggle Strafe Mode Used to toggle between normal movement and strafing movement. Default inputs are set to Y and Facebutton Top .

This step is required whether you plan to use the custom animations that you've already made or reuse the included default animations that the template provides. There are 2 ways to do this, You can reassign the skeleton for your skeletal mesh , (might not work on every mesh) Or you can retarget the Animation Blueprint to your skeletal mesh (recommended) Reassigning the Skeleton Reassigning skeleton is the faster way of the two, but it will not work on every skeletal mesh. The GunnerGirl_Skeleton is based on the rescaled version of UE4 Mannequin skeleton, so any skeletal mesh whose skeleton is based on the UE4 mannequin will most likely work with minimal issue when using this method. However, it's not really recommended to use this approach since it might not work with skeletal mesh whose joint orientation is set differently from the UE4 Mannequin. With that said, the steps are as follows, Right click on the skeletal mesh you wish to use for your character, Choose Skeleton, then choose Assign Skeleton A dialog window will appear, telling you to choose a skeleton. Choose the GunnerGirl_Skeleton, then press Accept. This will disassociate your mesh from its original skeleton, and set the GunnerGirl_Skeleton as your new skeleton. If reassignment is the method you choose, the animation blueprint that you'll be using for the next step is located at Content/FemaleShooter/Asset/GunnerGirl/Anim/GunnerGirl_AnimBP . Once you're ready, you can continue with the process and see the next steps here . Retarget the Animation Blueprint Based on our experience, retargeting the animation blueprint to your existing skeleton seems to be the more reliable method to setup your animation system. It does take a little bit more time to perform, but this approach can be done on most skeletal mesh, even if the skeleton skeleton structure is not based on the UE4 Mannequin. Instructions on how to retarget the Female Shooter animation blueprint to your character are as written below, First, you will need prepare your skeleton for the retargeting process. Detailed instruction on how to do this can be found in the retargeting preparation guide . Next, navigate to Content/FemaleShooter/Asset/GunnerGirl/Anim There will be 2 Animation Blueprints on that folder GunnerGirl_AnimBP GunnerGirl_AnimBP_WithDefaultAnimations For now, we will proceed with retargeting both of these Animation Blueprints to your chosen skeletal mesh. Further explanation on this subject will be explained further below. Right click on both files, choose Retarget Anim Blueprints, then choose Duplicate Anim Blueprints and Retarget A dialog window will appear. You will need to choose the skeleton asset of your chosen skeletal mesh here. Try unchecking the Show Only Compatible Skeletons option if your skeleton asset is not listed on the option. [Optional] Add a prefix and assign the folder for the New Asset Name This step is optional, but recommended. It might be helpful when you need to locate the newly generated asset using its name. Press the Retarget button Once the retargeting is done, several new files will be generated into your project. If retargeting is the approach you choose, the animation blueprint that you'll be using for the next step will be the one that the system generated for you based on the GunnerGirl_AnimBP animation blueprint. Once you're done with the retargeting process, you can proceed to the next steps by going here . If you wish to understand why 2 AnimBPs is being used in our retargeting example above, the explanation is given in the next section below. Regarding the Retargeted Animation Blueprint In the previous section, the retargeting process is performed on both GunnerGirl_AnimBP and GunnerGirl_AnimBP_WithDefaultAnimations . In practice, the only animation blueprint required by the Female Shooter system is GunnerGirl_AnimBP . The reason why both animation blueprints are retargeted in the example above, is because starting from version 1.2.0, the Female Shooter system stores each animations as a variable inside the Animation Blueprint. Due to this, when retargeting is performed only on GunnerGirl_AnimBP , only the Animation Blueprint itself will be retargeted, the default animations will not be included in the result. As a workaround to this condition, GunnerGirl_AnimBP_WithDefaultAnimations is provided as a redundant copy of GunnerGirl_AnimBP that can be used as a short handle to retarget all of the necessary default animations without having to explicitly selecting them one by one. Thus, to ensure that the animation blueprint and default animations are retargeted, both GunnerGirl_AnimBP and GunnerGirl_AnimBP_WithDefaultAnimations will need to be included in the process. Do note however, if you're planning to use your own custom animations with the Female Shooter template, retargeting only the GunnerGirl_AnimBP will be enough for your purpose. Connecting the Animation Blueprint to your Character Once the Animation Blueprint is ready, we can now apply it into the character. Instructions as follows, Open your character's blueprint Go to Components tab, select the Mesh component Go to Details tab, find the Mesh tab, Click on the Skeletal Mesh, make sure the value is set to your chosen skeletal mesh Next, still in the Details tab, find the Animation tab Set the value of Animation Mode to Use Animation Blueprint. Set the value of Anim Class into the Animation Blueprint that you've prepared previously. This should complete the basic setup for applying the Female Shooter character template to your character.

Open the Retarget Manager panel.

Once selected, there will be a list of bone names listed below this dropdown, separated into 2 columns, 'Source' and 'Target' . If your model's skeleton structure is compatible with Unreal, the editor will most likely already fill the values of your 'Target' column. However, if your model's skeleton structure is not compatible with Unreal, you might need to manually provide the the values yourself. Try matching each of the bones used in your model with the ones that is most closely related in the Unreal skeleton. Once that's done, make sure to adjust the pose of your model so that it resembles the A-Pose used by Unreal's third person mannequin model or the GunnerGirl model. You can do that by choosing the bones from the Skeleton Tree , and then manipulate the pose on the same window using the editor's gizmo.
